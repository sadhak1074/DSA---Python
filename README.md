## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https:https://github.com/sadhak1074/DSA---Python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd dsa-with-python
```

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can explore and run the different data structures and algorithms by navigating to their respective directories and running the Python scripts. For example, to run the binary search algorithm:

```bash
cd algorithms/search
python binary_search.py
```

Each script is designed to be self-contained and includes sample inputs for testing.
